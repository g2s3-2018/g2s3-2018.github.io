## Topics

The set of topics comprises an integrated and coherent presentation that starts with ill-posedness and regularization, develops mathematical and computational tools for sensitivity analysis and deterministic inversion via nonlinear least squares optimization, and elaborates a framework for formulation and solution of Bayesian inverse problems, building on several of the deterministic tools.

Morning lectures will be followed by hands-on afternoon lab sessions, where students will employ the methods presented in the lectures using state-of-the-art software and explore issues more deeply.

The summer school will culminate with presentations of projects the students have worked on in small teams during the latter part of the second week.
