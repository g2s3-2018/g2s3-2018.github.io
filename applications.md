## Applications are now open
The summer school is intended for PhD (and appropriate MS) students in mathematics, computer science, statistics, engineering, and science fields who wish to learn about state of the art methods for inverse problems. No background in inverse problems will be assumed, but students should have knowledge of numerical linear algebra, PDEs, and probability & statistics at the level of a first graduate (or upper-level undergraduate) course.

Part of our mission is to increase diversity in the fields of applied mathematics and computational science & engineering. We therefore particularly encourage female students and students from under-represented minority groups to apply, as well as students from smaller institutions.

### Application process

Selected applicants will be notified by e-mail in mid March, 2018.

### Financial support
Thanks to the generous sponsorship from SIAM, applicants selected to participate pay no registration fee, and costs of local accommodation and meals  will be covered for all participants.
