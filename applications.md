## Applications
The summer school is intended for PhD (and appropriate MS) students in mathematics, computer science, statistics, engineering, and science fields who wish to learn about inverse problems. No background in inverse problems will be assumed, but students should have knowledge of numerical linear algebra, PDEs, and probability & statistics at the level of a first graduate (or upper-level undergraduate) course.

### Applications are not open yet

The deadline for applications is February 1, 2018.

### Financial support
Thanks to the generous sponsorship from SIAM, applicants selected to participate pay no registration fee. Funding for local accommodations and meal expenses will be covered for all participants.
