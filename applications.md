## Applications are not open yet
The summer school is intended for PhD (and appropriate MS) students in mathematics, computer science, statistics, engineering, and science fields who wish to learn about state of the art methods for inverse problems. No background in inverse problems will be assumed, but students should have knowledge of numerical linear algebra, PDEs, and probability & statistics at the level of a first graduate (or upper-level undergraduate) course.

Part of our mission is to increase diversity in the fields of applied mathematics and computational science & engineering. We therefore particularly encourage female students and students from under-represented minority groups to apply, as well as students from smaller institutions.

### Application process

<!--- Applications are being accepted via Mathprograms.org (search under "Brown University"). --->
Applications will be accepted via [*Mathprograms.org*](https://mathprograms.org) (search under UC Merced).
To apply, the following documents --- all written in English  --- are required.
1. A filled application form ([Download PDF form](files/g2s3_studentform.pdf))
2. A letter of interest describing your relevant experience and motivation for participation in the 2018  G2S3 (2 pages maximum)
3. A curriculum vitae
4. A transcript listing titles of relevant courses you completed and grades received.
5. **A letter of recommendation**, to be submitted directly from your advisor through *Mathprograms.org*.

**The deadline for applications is February 1, 2018.**

Selected applicants will be notified by e-mail in mid March, 2018.

### Financial support
Thanks to the generous sponsorship from SIAM, applicants selected to participate pay no registration fee, and costs of local accommodation and meals  will be covered for all participants.

In addition, we will be able to offer (at least partial) travel support upon request. A request for funding will not influence the decision on acceptance to the school.
