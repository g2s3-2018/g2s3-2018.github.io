# Inverse Problems: Systematic Integration of Data with Models under Uncertainty
## 2018 Gene Golub SIAM Summer School


The ninth Gene Golub SIAM Summer School will take place
in Breckenridge, Colorado, USA in June 2018.
  
The summer school aims to introduce graduate students to the mathematical and 
computational aspects of inverse problems, particularly modern developments that 
emphasize the quantification of uncertainty in the inverse solution within the framework 
of Bayesian inference. The target audience is PhD and appropriate MS students in 
mathematics and related fields such as computer science, statistics, engineering, and 
science.

The central question we address is: How do we learn from data through the lens of models? The 
summer school will feature an integrated and coherent presentation that begins with ill-posedness 
and regularization, develops the ideas and tools for deterministic inversion via nonlinear least squares 
optimization, and elaborates formulations and solution methods for the modern Bayesian perspective, 
building on several of the deterministic tools. The concepts introduced in the morning lectures will be 
reinforced and put into practice in afternoon hands-on laboratory sessions using open-source software 
([hIPPYlib](https://hippylib.github.io), [MUQ](http://muq.mit.edu/)) implementing state-of-the-art deterministic and Bayesian inversion methods.
Students will work together on projects that will be presented on the last day of the school.
  
The summer school is being organized by [Omar Ghattas](http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~omar/) (The 
University of Texas at Austin), [Youssef Marzouk](http://aeroastro.mit.edu/faculty-research/faculty-list/youssef-m-marzouk) (MIT),
[Matthew Parno](http://mparno.mit.edu/) (US Army Corps of Engineers), [Noemi Petra](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/npetra/) (University of 
California, Merced), [Georg Stadler](http://math.nyu.edu/~stadler/index.html) (New York University), and 
[Umberto Villa](http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~uvilla/) (The University of Texas at Austin).

Applicants selected to participate pay no registration fee. Funding 
for local accommodations and meal expenses will be available for 
all participants.

More details regarding topics of the school, the avenue, and the application process will be soon avaialable at this website.
